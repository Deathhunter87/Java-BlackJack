# Java-BlackJack

Simple BlackJack game made to illustrate/practice using JavaFX

The game isnt perfect as each player has only 5 cards however in most BlackJack games there is no need for more than 5 cards

I did not include the bin in upload since the links to the photos are provided and can be substituted.

NOTE: I am NOT a UI designer nor am I good at it this is simply meant to illustrate my knowledge of Java FX
